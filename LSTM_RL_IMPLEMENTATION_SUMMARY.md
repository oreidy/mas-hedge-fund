# LSTM-Based Reinforcement Learning Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Implementing LSTM-based reinforcement learning for masters thesis hedge fund system using POMDP framework with dual-system architecture (LLM + RL refinement). Walk-forward training with 250-day initial window expanding over 750 trading days.

## Completed Work (Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure)

### Core Components Implemented
- **Data Collection Module**: `src/rl/data_collection/`
  - `TrainingEpisode` data model with serialization
  - `EpisodeCollector` for automated data gathering during backtesting
  - Signal encoding: bullish=1, neutral=0, bearish=-1

- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: `src/rl/preprocessing/`
  - `DataPreprocessor` for LSTM-ready sequence creation
  - `FeatureExtractor` for technical indicators and signal momentum
  - `ScalingUtils` supporting StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler

- **Backtester Integration**: Modified `src/backtester.py`
  - Added training data collection parameters
  - Episode collection during backtesting runs
  - JSON/pickle storage format support

### Key Technical Decisions
- JSON/pickle dual storage format for episodes
- Comprehensive feature extraction including consensus metrics
- Robust scaling options for different data types
- Immediate episode saving to avoid memory issues
- Modular architecture supporting different RL frameworks

### Dependencies Added
- `scikit-learn = "^1.3.0"`
- `scipy = "^1.11.0"`

### Testing Status
- Basic data collection tested successfully
- Test interrupted due to SEC filing fetch delays
- User needs to update insider trades separately using `prefetch_insider_trades.py`

## Placeholder Modules Created
- `src/rl/models/lstm_model.py` - LSTMTradingModel class
- `src/rl/training/trainer.py` - RLTrainer class  
- `src/rl/inference/inference.py` - RLInference class

## Next Steps (Phases 2-3)
1. **LSTM Model Architecture**
   - Implement actual LSTM model in `src/rl/models/lstm_model.py`
   - Design network architecture for sequential decision making
   - Add reward function with CVaR risk management

2. **Walk-Forward Training System**
   - Build training loop in `src/rl/training/trainer.py`
   - Implement expanding window approach (250-day initial + growth)
   - Add model checkpointing and validation

3. **RL Integration**
   - Create inference engine for real-time decision refinement
   - Integrate with existing backtester workflow
   - Performance tracking and evaluation metrics

## Data Structure Reference
```python
@dataclass
class TrainingEpisode:
    date: str
    agent_signals: Dict[str, Dict[str, AgentSignal]]
    llm_decisions: Dict[str, LLMDecision]
    portfolio_before: PortfolioState
    portfolio_after: PortfolioState
    portfolio_return: float
    market_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

## Usage Commands
- Data collection: `poetry run python test_backtester.py` (with training data enabled)
- Dependency management: `poetry install` after updating pyproject.toml
- Testing specific components: Use `src/test_backtester.py` for interactive testing

## Notes
- User mentioned need to update insider trades data before continuing
- System designed for 750 trading days of backtesting data
- Focus on risk-aware reward functions to prevent excessive leverage
- All episode data stored in configurable directory structure
